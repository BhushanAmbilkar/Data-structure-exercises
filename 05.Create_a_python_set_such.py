# Exercise 5: Create a Python set such that it shows the element from both lists in a pair

# Given:
#
# first_list = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# second_list = [4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]

# Show Hint
# Use the zip() function. This function takes two or more iterables (like list, dict, string), aggregates them in a tuple, and returns it.

first_list = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print("First List ", first_list)

second_list = [4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]
print("Second List ", second_list)

result = zip(first_list, second_list)
result_set = set(result)
print(result_set)
